Hello everyone, 

I have always been interested in finding out how things work and if they dont finding a way to make them work. I wanted to share a little about my journey as to how I discovered, I have a passion for code. 

My journey into the world of tech started at a very young age. I just didn't realize it till much later. I used to love taking apart the few electronics that we had in the home. To figure out how they worked and put them back together. My parents weren't always to happy about it, for example when I decided to take the cable box appart. The day after it was installed then run every program that I could just to see what it does and see how I could change it at 8 years old.

I have an appreciation for art. Art pieces are like puzzles that your trying to solve to grab someones attention. With each piece it can send a different message or make someone think in many different ways.

I continued on a when I got to highschool I took every computer class that was available along with every art class.
I went through high school in about 3 years. After graduation, I got married to my wonderful husband. Then, went to college for my Graphic Design degree. That's where the initial introduction to code began. 

My time in college. I went through several art classes and learning how to design and code websites from the front-end. Writing code to make something work is like sitting down and solving a sudoku puzzle or a rubix cube. Every turn or every number creates a different outcome. Figuring out the pieces that make it work the way that it is intended. Every piece solved gets you one step closer to success. I started by learning with dreamweaver. It was a great introduction piece for its time. I found out that I enjoyed coding when I graduated and worked as an intern for a web developer design the layouts and I was more interest in learning what they were doing to make my designs fuctionable. Over the next year, I learned many different techniques for how I could help them. I started learning how to make my designs with code instead of the design. Knowing both was wonderful cause to design the way I wanted it to look gave me a great start for what pieces of code I needed to create.

Then, thats where everything changed. I had started my family. I had my daughter which changed everything for the first couple of years. I was still interested in all the new tech and wanting to know how it works. All my time went to teaching my daughter. When she turned 5 my son was born. Now, that my daughter is 8 and my son is almost 4. I have more time during the day to focus more time on my passions and my children join me in the learning process. My daughter has watched me spend several hours a day coding and has developed an interest in learning how to code. She is interested in learning how to build her own websites and gaming apps. I'm finally to a point that my children are able to develop their own interest and grow with me. 

I am and will always be a wife and mother first. Now, they can be apart of what I do and we can have more freedom within our days for all of us to achieve our own goals. I love being able to teach my children how to work with their hands and their minds. 

I knew I wanted to do something with code and design. After, many years of research and learning on my own. I discovered bootcamps. I don't have the flexibility of going to a physical campus. To be able to work from home and still take care of my children and teach them in the process is apart of what drives my success. 

When I started applying to bootcamps. I was accepted by several bootcamps. It was a hard decision because I wanted to have the flexibility to work my hours on my courses and still have a community to work with on projects. I have spent between 8 to 12 hrs a day learning to code and catching up on how technology has changed in the last 8 years. While I have been focused on raising my family. I fully homeschool my children along with wanting to learn myself and progress my knowledge everyday. I wanted to choose the profession that felt natural and find something I enjoy I didn't want to end up doing something that I dreaded going to work everyday. With being a software engineer it is something that your always learning something new everyday. My journey od learning something new and progressing doesn't end when I finish bootcamp. My life revolves around learning and teaching something new all the time. With the more you know the better you'll be able to solve the puzzle. I finished my prepwork for 5 different bootcamps in about 6 weeks. 

After, I applied to multiple different schools. I started doing the pre-work spending a week rotating through the different courses. It gave me a good insight into how the curriculum was is going to be presented. It gave me a good starting point before the first round of interviews began. I knew what the school had to offer and if the bootcamp was going to be a good fit for my learning style and my lifestyle. I made the decision that I was going to complete all the prework for the bootcamps. Starting out there would be different pieces in the different courses, that would help me to understand the different pieces of the puzzle. Looking at it in different ways to find my groove for understanding. 

I finished my prepwork for Flatiron on July 17th. My cohort doesn't start til August 17th. I have a whole month to wait for it to start. During this time I have created my first website of being back in the game. I'm currently working on my own blog post. I have still spent 6 to 8 hrs a day studying, practicing code and finding the answers to my puzzle.

So, that's brings my journey to now. A little insight into where I want to be 10 years from now. Is in a great company being able to work from home and work where ever I am in the world. Have the flexibility of being on the water, in the mountains, or just a long road trip. While earning a respectable income to have financial and life freedom. I have the drive to succeed and accomplish the goals for the company and myself. I am willing to put in the long hours that is required to learn as much as I can during these beginning stages. WIth everyday my knowledge will grow and the things I am Having to think about now, will be second nature as long as I keep going and stay driven.

This is my first blog post I am open to any advice, improvements and suggestions. Thank you for taking the time to read a bit about my journey. I look forward to learning as much as possible and forever furthering my career by continuing to always keep learning.
